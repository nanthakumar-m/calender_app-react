# 📅 Calendar App – React 

This Calendar App is a lightweight and responsive React application that dynamically renders the current month and year, and highlights today’s date. It accurately aligns the dates to weekdays and adjusts for month length and leap years, providing a functional and visually neat calendar layout

The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with date and time logic in JavaScript, use React state and component structuring, and apply array-based rendering.
